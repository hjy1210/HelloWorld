* Describe several influential experiments that supported relativity.

## Special Relativity overview
* The speed of light is the same for all observers
* The laws of physics are the same for all observers

Flat spacetime is assumed in special relativity. So when you hear "special relativity" think "free fall/no gravity/flat spacetime"; and when you hear "general relativity" think "any frame/includes gravity/curved spacetime".

### 同時 Simultaneity
two events occur separated in space but at the same time.

* Assume two events occur that are separated in space and that are monitored in two frames with relative motion along that direction. If they are simultaneous in one frame...then the events are not simultaneous in the other. This goes by the name “Relativity of Simultaneity”. Here we emphasize that the events are separated in space and the motion is along direction of separation:

* If two events occur at the same point in space and are simultaneous in one frame then they are simultaneous in any frame.
* If the relative motion is transverse to the separation then the situation is different and, in particular, simultaneity is preserved. More on this in a moment.

### Length contraction
When the train is at rest on the ground, both observers (ground and train) agree on its length. When it moves at constant velocity, the observer on board measures the same length (we’ll call this $L$) as when the train is at rest. But the observer on the ground measures a shorter length, $L'$ . Here:

 $$ L'=L/\gamma$$

where , $\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^2}}$ is the Lorentz factor.

### 摘要
* Discussed the history of special relativity and Einstein’s postulates.
* E xplored concepts related to special relativity, including the constancy of c, aberration, relativity of simultaneity, and the Lorentz contraction.
* Applied these concepts to sample problems to illustrate the unusual features of special relativity.
