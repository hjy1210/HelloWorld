## Spacetime Events
## Lorentz Intervals
event1 in non-prime inertial frame and prime inertial frame: $(x_1,t_1)$, $[x_1',t_1']$

event2 in non-prime inertial frame and prime inertial frame: $(x_2,t_2)$, $[x_2',t_2']$

Lorentz Intervals between event1 and event2 are invariant between different inertial frames:

$$ (c\Delta t)^2-(\Delta x)^2=(c\Delta t')^2-(\Delta x')^2$$

### Timelike, Spacelike ans Lightlike intervals

* $(c\Delta t)^2>(\Delta x)^2$ 的時候叫做 Timelike interval
* $(c\Delta t)^2<(\Delta x)^2$ 的時候叫做 Spacelike interval
* $(c\Delta t)^2=(\Delta x)^2$ 的時候叫做 Lightlike interval

## Summary
* The analogy of locations in geography to events in physics.
* The analogy of the distance of separation in geography to the spacetime interval in physics.
* The importance of c for unifying space and time into spacetime.

* The fact that the distance of separation in geography (Euclidean geometry) is invariant even though points in space can bear different coordinate labels.
* The fact that the spacetime interval in physics (Lorentzian geometry) is invariant even though points in space and time can bear different coordinate labels.
* The mathematical form of the invariant (or Lorentzian or spacetime) interval.
* An experiment in which a moving clock advances less rapidly than clocks at rest in a lab followed by an analysis in terms of the invariant interval.
* The astronomical distance scale extending from our Solar system to the edge of the visible universe. 
* The first accurate measurement of the speed of light.
* An introduction to the masses and locales of three distinct types of black holes thought to exist in our universe.
